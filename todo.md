# To Do

 - Show heatmaps by clicking on each node (Or draw paths for best paths)
 - How do we show directionality of paths?
 - packet TTLs

 - adjust render speed

 - allow edges to change in latency (based on usage)?

 - show chart with sliding window instead of packet delivery averages
 - use dat.gui and have controls for settings constants
 - include progress bar to show how fully "trained" the grid is - maybe each node needs to have a certain number of iterations per address? This way it's easy to indicate that the grid has been reset?
